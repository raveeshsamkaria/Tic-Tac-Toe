## How to Play:

1. To make a move, the player will use the mouse single click to mark a box. In this version, there is no provision to undo the move. As soon as the move is done, the game proceeds to the next playerâ€™s chance.
2. At each move, the game will show whose move (Player 'X' or Player 'O') it is. When the game ends, it displays one of the following three outcomes:

* 'X' Wins
* 'O' Wins
* It's a Draw
